A program that extracts the following artifacts on a given time lapse:

• Registry branches changes date (CurrentVersionRun)

• Recent used/opened files

• Temporal files

• Installed programs

• Processes on execution

• Web browser history (Edge, Chrome, Firefox)

• Connected devices

• Events logs

If the user doesnt give your program a time range it should fall back to a default value, for ex: last 24h, last week, last month...
