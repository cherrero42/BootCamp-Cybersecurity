In this project, we work Cryptography block & Vulnerable Ciphers. We use C as language, to code a program named corsair. The list of allowed functions is as follows:

• All functions of <math.h>

• All functions of <string.h>

• The openssl library

• External functs. printf, snprintf, write, read, open, close, malloc, free


With this information, we create a tool that:

• Reads the public key of these certificates and get the modulus and exponent and then calculates the rest of the necessary data.

• Constructs the private key from two primes and their product, and from there, gets the symmetric key encrypted with it.

• Decrypts the message!
